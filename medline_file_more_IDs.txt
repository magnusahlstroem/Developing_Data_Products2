TI  - Anti-mullerian hormone levels are reduced in women living with human
      immunodeficiency virus compared to control women: a case-control study from
      Copenhagen, Denmark.
PG  - 123-127
AB  - Objectives: Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) is a marker of ovarian reserve. The
      purpose of this study was to compare AMH in women living with HIV with an
      age-matched control group of HIV-uninfected women, and to identify possible
      variables associated with decreasing AMH levels in women living with HIV.
      Methods: AMH was measured in frozen EDTA samples from 84 white women living with 
      HIV, aged 20 -40 years, with fully suppressed HIV RNA viral loads for at least 6 
      months and no hepatitis B or C virus co-infection. All women living with HIV were
      age-matched with HIV-uninfected control women. Results: Eighty-four women living 
      with HIV and 252 control women were included. Median age for the women living
      with HIV was 33.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 30.6-35.3), and 33.2 years
      (IQR 30.6-35.5) for the control women. A significant difference (P=0.03) was
      found in the mean AMH levels for all age groups combined, which was 17.23 pmol/L 
      (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.56-19.89) in the women living with HIV versus
      21.65 pmol/L (95% CI 19.50-23.81) in the control women, although levels were
      within reference limits in both groups.Only increasing age was significantly
      associated with decreasing AMH levels and not CD4 cell count, AIDS prior to
      inclusion, antiretroviral treatment/lack of treatment or antiretroviral treatment
      regimen. Conclusions: Well-treated, white women living with HIV in Denmark, have 
      reduced AMH levels compared with age-matched control HIV-uninfected women. The
      only variable associated with decreasing AMH levels in women living with HIV was 
      increasing age.

TI  - Smoking and renal function in people living with human immunodeficiency virus: a 
      Danish nationwide cohort study.
PG  - 391-9
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S83530 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Smoking is a main risk factor for morbidity and mortality in people
      living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV), but its potential association
      with renal impairment remains to be established. METHODS: We did a nationwide
      population-based cohort study in Danish PLHIV to evaluate the association between
      smoking status and 1) overall renal function and risk of chronic kidney disease
      (CKD), 2) risk of any renal replacement therapy (aRRT), and 3) mortality
      following aRRT. We calculated estimated creatinine clearance using the
      Cockcroft-Gault equation (CG-CrCl), and evaluated renal function graphically. We 
      calculated cumulative incidence of CKD (defined as two consecutive CG-CrCls of
      </=60 mL/min, >/=3 months apart) and aRRT and used Cox regression models to
      calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for risk of CKD, aRRT, and mortality rate 
      ratios (MRRs) following aRRT. RESULTS: From the Danish HIV Cohort Study, we
      identified 1,475 never smokers, 768 previous smokers, and 2,272 current smokers. 
      During study period, we observed no association of smoking status with overall
      renal function. Previous and current smoking was not associated with increased
      risk of CKD (adjusted IRR: 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7-1.7; adjusted
      IRR: 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9-1.8) or aRRT (adjusted IRR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.4-1.7; adjusted 
      IRR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.5-1.7). Mortality following aRRT was high in PLHIV and
      increased in smokers vs never smokers (adjusted MRR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.3-11.2).
      CONCLUSION: In Danish PLHIV, we observed no strong association between smoking
      status and renal function, risk of CKD, or risk of aRRT, but mortality was
      increased in smokers following aRRT.

      meningitis during the highly active antiretroviral therapy era: a nationwide
      cohort study.
PG  - 385-392
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S135309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with advanced
      immunosuppression predisposes to cryptococcal meningitis (CM). We describe the
      incidence, clinical presentation, and outcome of CM in HIV-infected individuals
      during the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. METHODS: A
      nationwide, population-based cohort of HIV-infected individuals was used to
      estimate incidence and mortality of CM including risk factors. A description of
      neurological symptoms of CM at presentation and follow-up in the study period
      1995-2014 was included in this study. RESULTS: Among 6,351 HIV-infected
      individuals, 40 were diagnosed with CM. The incidence rates were 3.7, 1.8, and
      0.3 per 1000 person-years at risk in 1995-1996, 1997-1999, and 2000-2014,
      respectively. Initiation of HAART was associated with decreased risk of acquiring
      CM [incidence rate ratio (IRR), 0.1 (95% CI, 0.05-0.22)]. African origin was
      associated with increased risk of CM [IRR, 2.05 (95% CI, 1.00-4.20)]. The main
      signs and symptoms at presentation were headache, cognitive deficits, fever, neck
      stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. All individuals diagnosed with CM had a CD4(+)
      cell count <200 cells/microl [median 26; interquartile range (IQR), 10-50)].
      Overall, mortality following CM was high and mortality in the first 4 months has 
      not changed substantially over time. However, individuals who survived generally 
      had a favorable prognosis, with 86% (18/21) returning to the pre-CM level of
      activity. CONCLUSION: The incidence of HIV-associated CM has decreased
      substantially after the introduction of HAART. To further decrease CM incidence
      and associated mortality, early HIV diagnosis and HAART initiation seems crucial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Estimated renal function (eRF) has been widely implemented as a
      screening tool in handling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
      individuals. Our primary objective was to investigate the agreement between
      measured renal function (mRF) and eRF in HIV-infected individuals in an everyday 
      clinical setting. METHODS: A single-center study at the HIV-outpatient clinic at 
      Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet. Study period from January 1,
      2004-June 1, 2015. We included all HIV-infected individuals who had an mRF
      performed and compared this with eRF assessed with 9 different
      serum-creatinine-based equations and the eRF reported by the Department of
      Clinical Biochemistry. We evaluated performance characteristics of the different 
      eRFs, with concordance correlation coefficient, total deviation index, coverage
      probability, relative accuracy, and Bland Altman plots. We also evaluated whether
      exposure to (1) rilpivirine, cobicistat, or dolutegravir (RLP/COB/DTG), (2)
      protease inhibitors (PIs), or (3) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) had an
      impact on agreement. Furthermore, we compared inter- and intra-individual
      differences between mRF and eRF. RESULTS: Ninety-eight individuals had an mRF
      performed during the study period. We found that the agreement between mRF and
      eRF was poor irrespective of the eRF equation. Exposure to RLP/COB/DTG and PIs
      was not associated with different agreement. Exposure to TDF was associated with 
      statistically significant better agreement for 3 of the evaluated equations.
      CONCLUSION: Irrespective of calculation methods, the agreement between mRF and
      eRF is poor. Surprisingly TDF exposure was associated with a better agreement
      compared with TDF-unexposed individuals.

      Population-Based Cohort Study.
PG  - 213-8
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000000825 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of HIV-infection among individuals >/= 50
      years of age has increased, the impact of HIV-infection on risk of death in this 
      population remains to be established. Our aim was to estimate long-term mortality
      among HIV-infected individuals who were 50 years or older, when compared with an 
      individually-matched cohort from the background population. METHODS:
      Population-based cohort-study including HIV-infected individuals >/= 50 years,
      who were alive 1 year after HIV-diagnosis (n = 2440) and a comparison cohort
      individually-matched by age and gender extracted from the background population
      (n = 14,588). Cumulative survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method and
      Mortality Rate Ratios (MRRs) were estimated using Cox Regression Models. Study
      period 1996-2014. RESULTS: Estimated median survival time from age 50 years for
      HIV-infected individuals increased from 11.8 years (95% CI: 10.2 to 14.5) during 
      1996-1999 to 22.8 years (20.0-24.2) in 2006-2014. MRR decreased with increasing
      age from 3.8 (3.1-4.7) for 50-55 years to 1.6 (1.0-2.6) for 75-80 years. In a
      cohort of well-treated HIV-infected individuals >/= 50 years without
      AIDS-defining events or comorbidity at study inclusion (n = 517). MRR was 1.7
      (1.2-2.3) compared with population controls without comorbidity. CONCLUSION:
      Among HIV-infected individuals estimated median survival time from age 50 years
      has increased by more than 10 years from 1996-1999 to 2006-2014, but is still
      substantially lower than in the background population. Even among well-treated
      HIV-infected individuals >/= 50 years without comorbidity or AIDS-defining events
      the estimated median survival time remains lower than in the general population.

      diseases: a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study.
PG  - 333-40
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S101288 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that targeted human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV) testing programs are cost-effective in populations with an HIV prevalence
      >0.1%. Several indicator diseases are known to be associated with increased risk 
      of HIV infection, but estimates of HIV frequency in persons with relevant
      indicator diseases are nonexistent. METHODS: In a nationwide population-based
      cohort study encompassing all Danish residents aged 20-60 years during 1994-2013,
      we estimated the 5-year risk of an HIV diagnosis (FYRHD) after a first-time
      diagnosis of 147 prespecified potential indicator diseases. To estimate the risk 
      of HIV diagnosis in the general population without any indicator diseases, we
      calculated the FYRHD starting at age 25, 35, 45, and 55 years. RESULTS: The risk 
      in the male general population was substantially higher than the female general
      population, and the risk was lower in the older age categories. Individuals of
      African origin had a higher FYRHD than individuals of Danish origin. A number of 
      diseases were identified with a FYRHD >0.1%, with infectious diseases, such as
      syphilis, hepatitis, and endocarditis, associated with a particularly high FYRHD.
      Other potential indicator diseases, such as most urologic, nephrologic,
      rheumatologic, and endocrine disorders were generally associated with a low
      FYRHD. CONCLUSION: Our study identified a large number of indicator diseases
      associated with a FYRHD >0.1%. These data can be used as a tool for planning
      targeted HIV screening programs.

TI  - Risk of Diabetes Mellitus among Patients Diagnosed with Giant Cell Arteritis or
      Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis: Comparison with the General Population.
PG  - 78-83
LID - 10.3899/jrheum.160797 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with organ- or life-threatening vasculitis receive high
      cumulative glucocorticoid (GC) doses during their disease course. GC have
      diabetogenic effects, but the risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) related to
      vasculitis therapy is not well characterized. We assessed the DM risk among
      patients diagnosed with giant cell arteritis (GCA) or granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis (GPA), i.e., patients with relatively common forms of systemic
      vasculitis. METHODS: We used Danish healthcare registries to identify 1682
      patients diagnosed with GCA and 342 patients diagnosed with GPA from 1997 to 2015
      and to obtain information regarding medication exposures. Each patient with
      vasculitis was matched with 9 population controls. Date of new-onset DM was
      defined as date of first claimed prescription for an antidiabetic drug. We used
      Cox regression analyses to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRR) for DM as a
      measure of the DM risk among patients relative to population controls. Logistic
      regression was used to study the association between prednisolone/prednisone
      (PRED) dose and DM. RESULTS: Median duration of followup was 6.5 years
      [interquartile range (IQR) 2.6-10.4] in the GCA cohort and 5.8 years (IQR
      1.7-10.6) in the GPA cohort. During the first year after diagnosis of vasculitis,
      the IRR for DM was 7.0 (95% CI 5.2-9.3) among patients with GCA and 10.4 (95% CI 
      4.4-24) among patients with GPA. IRR for DM were not significantly increased in
      either cohort during later followup periods. Within the first year, treatment
      with high cumulative prednisolone/PRED doses was associated with new-onset DM
      among the patients with vasculitis. CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with GCA or
      GPA have a markedly increased risk of new-onset DM during early treatment phases.

TI  - Impact of pre-existing co-morbidities on mortality in granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis: a cohort study.
PG  - 649-53
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/kev390 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of pre-existing co-morbidities on mortality among
      patients affected by granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). METHODS: By means of
      the Danish National Hospital Register, we identified a cohort of patients
      hospitalized for GPA during 1994-2010 (n = 308). The burden of pre-existing
      co-morbidities among the patients was quantified according to the Charlson
      Comorbidity Index (CCI). Each patient was matched with five age- and
      gender-matched population controls with no pre-existing co-morbidities captured
      by the CCI (CCI score = 0). The study subjects were followed throughout 2010. Cox
      regression analyses were used to calculate mortality rate ratios (MRRs). RESULTS:
      The median duration of follow-up in the GPA cohort was 5.8 years (interquartile
      range 2.3-10.0). Compared with their matched population controls, the MRR for
      patients presenting with a CCI score of 0 (n = 246) was 3.9 (95% CI 2.0, 7.5)
      during years 0-2 and 1.4 (95% CI 0.9, 2.0) from the second year of follow-up
      onwards. The corresponding MRRs were 13.3 (95% CI 5.8, 31) and 1.9 (95% CI 1.1,
      3.6) for patients with a CCI score 1 (n = 62). In a direct comparison, GPA
      patients with a CCI score 1 were found to have significantly higher mortality
      than GPA patients with a CCI score of 0 during years 0-2 [adjusted MRR 3.4 (95%
      CI 1.6, 7.0)] but not after >2 years of follow-up [adjusted MRR 1.3 (95% CI 0.7, 
      2.6)]. CONCLUSION: During early follow-up periods, the mortality among GPA
      patients with pre-existing co-morbidities is markedly higher than that among GPA 
      patients with no pre-existing illnesses. Our analyses identify an increased CCI
      score for pre-existing co-morbidities as an important risk factor for a fatal
      outcome in GPA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-associated incidence and prognosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis
      (CTX) is not well established during later years. METHODS: From the Danish HIV
      Cohort Study, we identified 6325 HIV-infected individuals. We assessed incidence,
      mortality, predictive and prognostic factors of CTX during the pre-combination
      antiretroviral therapy (pre-cART; 1995-1996) and cART-era (1997-2014). Adjusted
      incidence rate ratios (aIRR), mortality rate ratios (aMRR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were assessed using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: CTX IR
      was 1.17/1000 PYR (95% CI 0.93-1.47). We observed no change in CTX-risk in the
      first year after HIV-diagnosis, but a substantial reduction in mortality in the
      first 3 months after CTX diagnosis when comparing the cART-era to the
      pre-cART-era; {(aIRR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.37-1.72) (aMRR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.06-0.38)}. 
      For individuals surviving the first year after HIV-diagnosis or the first 3
      months after CTX-diagnosis, IRR and MRR had declined to minimal levels {(aIRR:
      0.06; 95% CI: 0.03-0.10); (aMRR: 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01-0.05)}. Three years after
      CTX-diagnosis 30% of the patients still had neurological deficits. CONCLUSION:
      Although, CTX remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the
      cART-era, with high prevalence of neurological sequelae, incidence and mortality 
      has largely declined, especially among those surviving the first year after
      diagnosis.

TI  - Incidence of benign prostate hypertrophy in Danish men with and without HIV
      infection.
PG  - 2315-22
LID - 10.1097/QAD.0000000000000804 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on risk of benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) in
      HIV-infected men is sparse. We aimed to estimate the incidence of being diagnosed
      with BPH among HIV-infected men compared with an age and sex-matched comparison
      cohort from the background population. To exclude that family-associated risk
      factors influence risk of BPH diagnoses in families of HIV-infected individuals, 
      we estimated risk of BPH in fathers of HIV-infected men and fathers of the
      comparison cohort. METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based, matched cohort
      study, we calculated incidence rates and used Poisson regression models to
      calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of being diagnosed with BPH, defined as
      the earliest of date of the second redeemed prescription of a drug used to treat 
      BPH, the first registration of a BPH diagnosis in the Danish National Hospital
      Registry (DNHR) or the first registration of a surgical procedure for BPH in
      DNHR. RESULTS: We identified 4633 HIV-infected men, 46 330 comparison cohort
      individuals, 1585 fathers of HIV-infected men and 20 449 fathers of the
      comparison cohort. Incidence rate of being diagnosed with BPH was 37.0 [95%
      confidence interval (95% CI) 31.5-43.1] per 10 000 person-years of follow-up
      among HIV-infected men and was not increased compared with the comparison cohort 
      (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 0.88-1.22). Risk was not increased for fathers of HIV-infected 
      men vs. fathers of the comparison cohort (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.12). Stratified
      analyses did not change the above results markedly. CONCLUSION: HIV-infected
      individuals do not have an increased risk of being diagnosed with BPH.

TI  - Cohort profile update: the Danish HIV Cohort Study (DHCS).
PG  - 1769-9e
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyu153 [doi]
AB  - The DHCS is a cohort of all HIV-infected individuals seen in one of the eight
      Danish HIV centres after 31 December 1994. Here we update the 2009 cohort profile
      emphasizing the development of the cohort. Every 12-24 months, DHCS is linked
      with the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) in order to extract an age- and
      sex-matched comparison cohort from the general population, as well as cohorts of 
      family members of the HIV-infected patients and of the comparison cohort. The
      combined cohort is linked with CRS, the Danish Cancer Registry, the Danish
      National Hospital Registry, the Danish Registry of Causes of Death, the Danish
      National Prescription Registry, the Attainment Register and the Integrated
      Database for Labour Market Research to get information on vital status,
      migration, cancer, hospital contacts, causes of death, dispensed prescriptions,
      education and employment. Using this design, rates of a range of outcomes have
      been compared between HIV-infected patients and the comparison cohort, as well as
      between families of these two cohorts in order to disaggregate the effects of HIV
      infection and familial/environmental factors. Data can be shared with foreign
      institutions following approval from the Danish Data Protection Agency. Potential
      collaborators can contact the study director, Niels Obel (e-mail:

TI  - Association between smoking status assessed with plasma-cotinine and inflammatory
      and endothelial biomarkers in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals.
LID - 10.1111/hiv.12647 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Smoking is a major contributor to mortality and morbidity in
      HIV-positive individuals. Our primary objective was to evaluate the association
      between smoking status determined by plasma cotinine (P-cotinine) concentration
      and inflammatory and endothelial biomarkers in HIV-positive versus HIV-negative
      individuals. METHODS: We studied eight inflammatory/endothelial biomarkers
      [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), E-selectin, soluble vascular cell
      adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1
      (sICAM-1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tissue type 
      plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (tPAI) and endothelin] in 105 HIV-positive
      individuals and 105 HIV-negative individuals matched on age, sex and
      self-reported smoking status. Smoking status was determined using P-cotinine (a
      concentration > 14 ng/mL was defined as demonstrating exposure to smoke). We used
      linear regression models to (1) examine the association between smoking status
      and inflammatory/endothelial biomarkers in HIV-positive compared with
      HIV-negative individuals, and (2) to determine whether there was evidence to
      suggest that the impact of smoking status on the biomarkers differed between
      HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. RESULTS: Of the eight biomarkers,
      smokers had increased hsCRP, sICAM-1 and MMP-9 concentrations irrespective of HIV
      status and increasing P-cotinine concentration was associated with increasing
      hsCRP concentration. We found no interaction between smoking and HIV status. HIV 
      infection was associated with increased hsCRP, E-selectin, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1 and
      MMP-9 concentrations. Self-reported smoking status differed substantially from
      smoking status assessed with P-cotinine. CONCLUSIONS: Several biomarkers were
      associated with smoking status and HIV status. However, our data do not indicate 
      that the effects of smoking on the biomarkers differ between HIV-positive and
      HIV-negative individuals.

TI  - Short contact with nickel causes allergic contact dermatitis: an experimental
      study.
LID - 10.1111/bjd.16935 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the required duration of exposure for elicitation of 
      allergic nickel dermatitis in nickel allergic individuals is limited. However, it
      often has been proposed that short skin contact is safe. OBJECTIVE: To examine
      whether repeated skin contact with nickel over short time periods (3 x 10
      minutes) can elicit allergic nickel dermatitis. METHODS: Sixteen nickel allergic 
      adults and 10 control subjects were exposed to, respectively, nickel and
      aluminium containing discs on each volar forearm and on each earlobe for 3 x 10
      minutes. One arm was pretreated for 24 hours with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate
      (SLS) under occlusion before exposure. One aluminium- and one nickel exposure
      site were clinically evaluated and blood flow was measured with laser Doppler
      flowmetry at day 2 (D2) and D4. RESULTS: Ten of 16 (62.5%) nickel allergic
      participants developed allergic nickel dermatitis on SLS pretreated arm skin and 
      3/16 (18.8%) on normal skin on the earlobe. On the SLS pretreated arms of nickel 
      allergic participants, blood flow increased significantly more on the nickel
      exposed skin compared with the aluminium exposed skin on D2 and D4. No change in 
      clinical reactivity or blood flow was found on normal forearm skin in nickel
      allergic participants or on any skin in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This
      experimental study showed that relatively short repeated skin contact (3 x 10
      minutes) with metallic nickel elicits allergic nickel dermatitis in irritated
      skin and at sites with previous dermatitis. The results support the restrictions 
      in current nickel regulation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of skin cancer in HIV-infected patients has not been
      extensively studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of skin cancer in
      HIV-infected patients and compare it with the risk in the background population. 
      METHODS: In a matched, nationwide population-based cohort study we compared the
      risk of skin cancer in 4280 HIV-infected patients from the Danish HIV cohort
      study with a background population cohort, according to the level of
      immunosuppression and route of transmission. Primary outcomes were time to first 
      basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or malignant melanoma 
      (MM). RESULTS: HIV-infected patients had an increased risk of BCC and SCC with
      IRRs of 1.79 (95% CI 1.43 - 2.22) and 5.40 (95% CI 3.07 - 9.52), respectively,
      compared with the background population. We observed no increased risk of MM. Low
      nadir CD4 cell count was associated with an increased risk of SCC. The increased 
      risk of BCC among HIV-infected patients was restricted to men who had sex with
      men. LIMITATIONS: Observational design. Small number of patients with melanoma.
      CONCLUSION: HIV-infected patients have an increased risk of BCC and SCC. Low
      nadir, but not current, CD4 cell count as a marker of immunosuppression was
      associated with an increased risk of SCC.

PG  - 984-993
LID - 10.1111/wrr.12605 [doi]
AB  - We explored use of the suction-blister wound model in the assessment of not only 
      epidermal regeneration but also pain, the microvascular response and
      bacteriology. The effects of topical zinc sulfate were studied to articulate the 
      methodologies in this double-blind trial. One epidermal suction blister (10 mm)
      was induced on each buttock in 30 healthy volunteers (15 females:15 males) and
      deroofed on day 0. The wounds were randomized to daily treatment with 1.4% zinc
      sulfate shower gel (n = 20), placebo (n = 20) or control (n = 20). Digital
      photography coupled with planimetry, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement
      and optical coherence tomography (OCT) was benchmarked to the gold standard of
      histology of 60 full-thickness wound biopsies on day 4. Pain increased after
      application of the shower gels. Microvessel density, determined from OCT images, 
      increased from day 0 to day 2 in the three groups but increased more with the
      placebo than with the zinc shower gel (p = 0.003) or the control treatment (p =
      0.002) and correlated (rS = 0.313, p = 0.015) with the inflammatory response on
      day 4, as determined by histology. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were more
      common in wounds compared with skin (p = 0.002) and was reduced (p = 0.030) with 
      zinc sulfate treatment. Planimetric analysis of digital wound images was not
      biased (p = 0.234) compared with histology, and TEWL measurements showed no
      correlation (rS = 0.052, p = 0.691) with epithelialization. Neoepidermal
      formation, determined by histology, did not differ (p = 0.290) among the groups. 
      Zinc sulfate reduced (p = 0.031) the release of lactate dehydrogenase from
      cultured gel-treated keratinocytes isolated from the blister roofs. Therefore,
      combination of the standardized suction-blister wound model with noninvasive
      planimetry and OCT is a useful tool for assessing wound therapies. Zinc sulfate
      transiently dampened inflammation and reduced bacterial growth.

TI  - Prevalence of nickel allergy in Europe following the EU Nickel Directive - a
      review.
PG  - 193-200
LID - 10.1111/cod.12846 [doi]
AB  - Nickel contact allergy remains a problem in EU countries, despite the EU Nickel
      Directive. To study the prevalence of nickel allergy in EU countries following
      the implementation of the EU Nickel Directive, we performed a systematic search
      in PubMed for studies that examined the prevalence of nickel allergy in EU
      countries published during 2005-2016. We identified 46 studies: 10 in the general
      population and 36 in patch tested dermatitis patients. A significantly lower
      prevalence of nickel allergy after than before the implementation of the EU
      Nickel Directive was found in women aged 18-35 years (11.4% versus 19.8%) (p =
      0.02), in female dermatitis patients aged </=17 years (14.3% versus 29.2%) (p <
      0.0001), and in dermatitis patients aged 18-30 years (women: 20.2% versus 36.6%) 
      (p < 0.0001) (men: 4.9% versus 6.6%) (p < 0.0001). Overall, the prevalence was
      higher in southern than in northern EU countries, and generally remained high,
      affecting 8-18% of the general population. A consistent pattern of decreasing
      prevalence of nickel allergy in some EU countries was observed, although the
      prevalence among young women remains high. Steps should be taken for better
      prevention of nickel allergy in EU countries.

      tomography.
PG  - 65-72
LID - 10.1111/srt.12391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Our objective was to assess epithelialization of suction
      blister lesions by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and benchmark it to
      histology using epidermal thickness (ET) as the primary outcome. METHODS:
      Thirty-two healthy volunteers were recruited to Study 1 and 2. One 10-mm suction 
      blister was raised on each buttock, and the blister roof was excised. Lesions
      were covered with moisture-retaining dressing. In Study 1, the lesions were
      OCT-scanned on day 0 (D0), D2 and D4 and excised for histological examination. In
      Study 2, the progress of epithelialization and skin barrier function were
      monitored to D14. RESULTS: ET increased from D0 to D2 by 46 mum (P<.001) and from
      D2 to D4 by 19 mum (P=.004). Compared with histology, OCT overestimated the
      presence of the epithelium (P<.0001) and ET on D4. Reliable measurements were
      obtained when the ET of the lesions reached the ET of the normal epidermis from
      D5-D7 and onwards. The ET development was reflected in decreased transepidermal
      water loss. CONCLUSION: We found that the OCT technique was poorly discriminative
      with respect to the neoepithelium and the moist lesion surface material in the
      early postinjury period. In the later stages, OCT seemed valuable for estimating 
      the advancement of epithelialization.

PG  - 325-332
LID - 10.1111/cod.12782 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nickel in metallic items has been regulated in Denmark since 1990;
      however, 10% of young Danish women are still sensitized to nickel. There is a
      need for continuous surveillance of the effect of regulation. OBJECTIVES: To
      identify current self-reported metallic exposures leading to dermatitis in
      nickel-allergic patients, and the minimum contact time needed for dermatitis to
      occur. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all patients who reacted positively
      to nickel sulfate 5% pet. within the last 5 years at the Department of
      Dermatology and Allergy, Gentofte Hospital. RESULTS: The response rate was 63.2%.
      Earrings were the foremost cause of dermatitis after the EU Nickel Directive had 
      been implemented, followed by other jewellery, buttons on clothing, belt buckles,
      and wrist watches. Dermatitis reactions within 10 min of contact were reported by
      21.4% of patients, and dermatitis reactions within 30 min of contact were
      reported by 30.7% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nickel exposures that led to the
      implementation of a nickel regulation seem to persist. The durations of contact
      with metallic items to fall under the current REACH regulation of nickel
      correspond well with the results of this study.

TI  - Rapid allergen-induced interleukin-17 and interferon-gamma secretion by
      skin-resident memory CD8(+) T cells.
PG  - 218-227
LID - 10.1111/cod.12715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin-resident memory T (TRM ) cells are associated with immunological
      memory in the skin. Whether immunological memory responses to allergens in the
      skin are solely localized to previously allergen-exposed sites or are present
      globally in the skin is not clear. Furthermore, the mechanisms whereby TRM cells 
      induce rapid recall responses need further investigation. OBJECTIVES: To study
      whether contact allergens induce local and/or global memory, and to determine the
      mechanisms involved in memory responses in the skin. METHODS: To address these
      questions, we analysed responses to contact allergens in mice and humans
      sensitized to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene and nickel, respectively. RESULTS:
      Challenge responses in both mice and humans were dramatically increased at sites 
      previously exposed to allergens as compared with previously unexposed sites.
      Importantly, the magnitude of the challenge response correlated with the
      epidermal accumulation of interleukin (IL)-17A-producing and interferon
      (IFN)-gamma-producing TRM cells. Moreover, IL-17A and IFN-gamma enhanced
      allergen-induced IL-1beta production in keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS: We show that 
      sensitization with contact allergens induces a strong, long-lasting local memory 
      and a weaker, temporary global immunological memory response to the allergen that
      is mediated by IL-17A-producing and IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) TRM cells.

AB  - AIMS: Evaluation of patients with primary mitral valve insufficiency (MI) is best
      supported by quantitative measures. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging
      (CMR) offers flow and cardiac chamber volume quantification. We studied cardiac
      remodelling with CMR to determine MI regurgitation volumes (MIVol) related to
      severe MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 24, 20, and 28 patients determined to
      have mild, moderate, and severe primary MI, respectively, were studied. Combining
      cine stacks with phase-contrast velocity mapping across the ascending aorta,
      CMR-determined MIVol was reproducibly obtained as the difference between left
      ventricular (LV) stroke volume and aortic forward flow (Aoflow). With increasing 
      MI severity, MIVol, left heart volumes, and pulmonary venous diameters increased 
      (P < 0.01). Severe MI with LV end-systolic diameter of 40 mm was signified by
      MIVol >40 mL, MI regurgitant fraction >0.30, LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV(i))
      >108 mL m(-2), and a total left heart volume >188 mL m(-2) with dilated pulmonary
      veins and a LVEDV/right ventricular EDV ratio >1.2. In severe MI, LV ejection
      fraction was unaffected, but the Aoflow and the peak ejection rate indexed to
      LVEDV were lowered (P < 0.05). In surgical patients, the MIVol correlated to the 
      decrease in LV dimension after valve surgery (P < 0.02). CONCLUSION: CMR provides
      a reproducible quantitative technique for evaluation of MI, as MIVol and cardiac 
      chamber volumes can be held against diagnostic cut-off values. The Aoflow and
      peak ejection rate indexed to LVEDV may reveal early LV systolic dysfunction in
      patients with severe MI. Severe MI is related to lower MI regurgitation volume
      and fraction than previously believed.
